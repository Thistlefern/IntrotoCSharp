There are a number of improvements that can be made to the Dumb Guess the number example.

1. It seems to be super predictable,and in fact unimaginative in the numbers it guesses. Should probably fix this.
	I might be able to find some clues around the predicitbility of the system by checking Microsofts page here
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netcore-3.1

	***Removed the entered seed of 123, as this was restricting the seed to that of 123, instead of seleceting a new random seed each game.

2. Even though I tell it I want more than 5 tries or I want the range to be so much greater than just 20 (and it does comply) it still only tells me I have just 5 tries etc. Gotta fix this.
	
	***Utilized ceiling and numberOfTries properties in place of the numbers (20 and 5, respectively) to appropriately represent the numbers entered.

3. Every now and then it'll crash starting with the error "Unhandled exception. blah blah" need to fix that at some point. Seems to happen before it even does anything.
	
	***As I haven't seen this issue, I can't troubleshoot it, but I'm sure that, as this is all a test, you know the solution and you can tell me what would need doing in this situation :)

4. It's a one shot deal, I need to get back to this and get it so I can challenge the proram to 3 matches or something, maybe then keep track of wins & losses and get a score at the end of it.
	
	***I added a for loop that asks you to hit enter at the end of the game, then adds a number to a counter of how many games you've played and restarts the game with a new random number.

5. There's got to be a better way of making notes about what I want to do and change in my code, reluctant to add comments everywhere in my code coz I might miss something, if only there was some kind of task list or something.
	
	***There is a task list option in the view drop-down menu. You can add comments to your to do list by putting TODO after the // used to create a comment.

6. Even when it says I guessed it it says I've lost, whats with this.
	
	***Added an additional else if statement to resolve this. The "You Lost" message was outsite of the if/if else statements, and thus always showed up.

	***Additional edits/fixes***
		- Changed statement of how many tries it took to guess, as it was always stating how many guess that you had LEFT instead of how many you had USED.
		- Changed font case of Too high/low, try again statements, as a capital T on Try again was jarring to my eyes.
